## A closer look at source{d}’s rebranding

### Molto vivace

We’re now moving fast on design as well. We have a design team of one, but we strongly believe that the design team it’s composed by every single member in our company. We’re very excited for the tools we’ve been building, and now is the time for design to jump onboard, with a humble goal, it’s not about how fast you ship, but how fast you learn, while shipping.

### First things first

Our strategy is to continually create and foster a design culture of shared ownership. Moreover, we believe design is sustainable with  the emphasization of ethics over aesthetics, grounding the expression of a creative practice where design systems are crafted for the needs of the present without compromising the future. We think twice about the life-cycle of the digital artifacts we give birth to.

With this in mind, we’re at the very beginning of source{d}’s rebranding, and the primary quest was the personification of our brand, so our goal was to create a Brand Persona. It was grounded on collaborative accomplishment, point made, fostering a common ground of understanding was of the essence, acknowledging as well the importance of the first design artifacts of what will become a brand design system.

### All aboard

We conducted some research to reach base one. It was stunning to see everybody excited speaking out loud about their beliefs and the passion that drives them. “Honest work for fun on funny things” it’s a glimpse on how we sparkled team’s spirit all over this journey. We knew from the start that albeit design’s written word was still immature, it shouted strong diverse aesthetic: “I don't think a nile crocodile is serious. It's always smiling :)” and so the journey from individual to unified vision began.

We believe that design is a team sport, and it happens when there is such knowledge management, its transfer and openness within a team that it raises the standards of the critical environment. Design must capacitate everyone involved with the power to surface the value of collective truth, driving the momentum far and near the birthing of design’s written word towards its visual translation.

### Cookin’ on three burners

Genuine design happens when we acknowledge that design without rationale is a mere aesthetic exercise. Moreover, the urge for better experiences is hinged on better people not on better design. Bringing it all together, we genuinely praise people above all.

The visual translation started fuelled with qualitative data, quantitative data and our company culture. We first started looking for some typography options, and in the process, we stumble upon [Free Font Ballon](https://www.behance.net/gallery/55482949/Free-Font_Balloon) by the incredibly talented [Aga Magdziak](https://www.behance.net/aga735d). After a couple of minutes we found out that there was more to Aga than meets the eye. Along with the typeface, Aga created a huge set of visual artifacts that caught our attention. We like to think of what we discovered as open source design, and we deeply believe in it. In the end we came up with a design lexicon - a branch of knowledge - that empowered us create the Brand Persona, and it was data-oriented all the way.

### Claws that can grab a dinosaur

With a lexicon, we had all we needed to create the Brand Persona’s visual translation. After vivid care on content analysis we chose to give birth to {d}ali, a quite particular parrot. A parrot has the distinct characteristic of easily learn languages, and that pretty much stroked our agenda. Then, we had to make sure that our Brand Persona personality and traits would reflect on {d}ali aesthetics. Its claws translate our brand’s trustworthiness, its tail translate our brand’s enthusiasm and {d}ali’s head is all about being genuine, mainly because it gathers characteristics from several parrots, each one reinforcing our rational. And this, is how {d}ali was born.

We deeply believe in co-creation. Our pathway towards innovation is not to simply share our evolution, but rather to evolve together with the community one step at a time.

We have an honest attention to the group, along with an extreme care on the individual. Like as in good typography, we care about our community not as a group of important people, but an important group of people, by choice.

So please, feel free to check the assets we’ve created for the Brand Persona and be so kind to share your thoughts on our brand new design channel in our [Slack Community](http://missing-link)

Here you can find the [source{d}'s Brand Persona](http://missing-link) and [{d}ali's Lexicon](http://missing-link).

### One, two, buckle my shoe

This is base one, and we’ve reached it. Now, we’re studying our brand touchpoints that will allow us to give birth to a design system and to reach second base. In order to move to third base, we need to reflect our brand unique values and personality traits on the connection between its every single community touchpoints. Defining how the company, as a person, builds its brand relationship with our community is the fourth base. So, stay tuned, more news will come soon(ish)!
